## Project Motivation 
Inspired by our love for the classic board game [Settlers of Catan](https://www.catan.com/), our team decided to create an AI agent to play the game optimally. To win Catan, a player must strategically place settlements and roads, decide when to spend or save precious resources, and accumulate enough Victory Points to end the game in their favor. With a wide range of actions to choose from each turn, we were motivated to develop an AI agent that makes rational decisions, even in a very large state space. 

## Implementation Overview 
### State Space 
We broke down our state space into three main sections–Player, Board, and Action–described below: 

1. **Player**
    * **Hand**: Dictionary containing each card type (keys) and the associated counts (values)
    * **ID and Color**: Unique player ID number and their assigned RGB color value 
    * **Development Cards**: Queue of *development cards* held by the player, drawn from the board's development card 
    * **Points**: Number of Victory Points a player has 
    * **Settlements Left, Roads Left, Cities Left**: Number of each structure that a player may still build, initialized to `5`, `15`, and `4`, respectively
    * **Longest Road and Largest Army**: Flags set to True if the player currently holds the respective title; otherwise, False
2. **Board**
    * 

3. **Action**
    *

### Game Modifications & Assumptions 
To reduce game complexity and enable efficient agent training, we made the following modifications and assumptions:

* Removed player-to-player trading, so resource acquisition depends solely on dice rolls, building, and bank trades
* Removed ports, limiting favorable trade ratios thereby reducing strategic flexibility
* Assumed the AI agent plays against three random opponents, as defined in the `Pygame` implementation
